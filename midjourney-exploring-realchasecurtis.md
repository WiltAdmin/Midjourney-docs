# Midjourney v5 Lighting Tips

Lighting is one of the most important aspects of your prompt, as it directly affects the quality and mood of the image. 

Proper lighting can enhance the details, colors, and textures of the generation, while poor lighting can result in a dull or unappealing output image.

This tweet will act as your Lighting 101 class. 

And class is now in session...

→ Natural Lighting
"Sunlight" - Common source of lighting for outdoor images.

"Moonlight" - Natural lighting that creates a soft/ethereal effect.

"Firelight" or "Candlelight" - Warm and cozy light source that helps create rustic and romantic effects for indoors.

"Cloudy Skies" or "Overcast" - Soft and diffused natural light for portrait photography.

"Reflections" - Can provide artistic shimmering and dreamy effect when paired with other lighting.

→ Ambient Lighting
"Overhead" - Light fixtures like ceiling lights or chandeliers for lighting indoor scenes.

"Wall Sconces" - Adds a decorative element to a room while providing soft, indirect lighting effect.

"Table Lamps" - May provide warm and cozy effect OR bright and harsh lighting.

"Floor Lamps" - Helps provide warm and cozy effect, but also lights the corners of the scene.

"Natural Light" - "Windows" or "Skylights" can provide consistent lighting throughout the scene.

→ Artificial & Directional Lighting
"Studio Lights" - Powerful/controlled light source best for portrait, product, and fashion.

"Strobe Lights" - Flash photography with bright light to illuminate the subject.

"Ring Lights" - Circular light source for portrait generations to provide a flattering and even lighting effect.

"LED Lights" - Can provide a range of color temperatures.

"Butterfly Lighting" - Light placed directly above and slightly in front of subject to create shadow under the nose.

"Rembrandt Lighting" - A triangular-shaped patch of light under one eye creating a dramatic shadowy effect.

"Split Lighting" - Light source is at a 90-degree angle to the subject face creating a half-and-half shadow effect.

"Rim Lighting" - Light source is placed behind the subject, illuminating the edges of the subject's silhouettes for a dramatic/moody effect.

"Low-Key Lighting" - Minimal lighting with only one or two sources for dramatic/moody effect.

"High-Key Lighting" - Bright and even lighting to create a light/airy effect.

"Top Light" - Creates shadows and highlights emphasizing texture and shape.

"Side Light" - A light source that creates strong shadows and highlights emphasizing texture and shape.

"Backlighting" - Light source is placed behind the subject to create a bright/glowing halo effect.

→ Hard & Soft Lighting
"Direct Sunlight" - Creates a strong, well-defined shadows on the subject.

"Spot Lighting" - Strong beam of light creating shadows and highlights.

"Halogen Bulbs" - A strong, harsh, and intense light for commercial and industrial settings.

"Laser Lighting" - Use of lasers to create a strong light source for stage production and concert effects.

"Fresnel Lighting" - A special lens that focuses the light source for theater and film effects.

"Hard Fill Lighting" - A second light source that fills in shadows created by primary light source for commercial and fashion prompts.

"Window Light" - Soft lighting used most commonly for indoor portraits.

"Cloudy Days" - Natural source of soft lighting.

"Softbox Lighting" - Softens the light and creates better distribution across the subject.

"Umbrella Lighting" - Reflects and diffuses light creating a soft and even effect.

"Beauty Dish Lighting" - A soft and flattering light effect used for portrait photography.

In order to craft the perfect prompt, you may have to remove, add, or rearrange words from each keyword suggest in this tweet.

# Midjourney v5 Theme Tips

The default theme for v5 is "realistic photography", so you can use the following prompt keywords to get something different/fresh.

The phrases and/or words inside the square brackets [ ] denote what prompts the theme might work well with.

P.S. This thread will act as the 'definitive guide' to themes in Midjourney, and will span across multiple extra-long tweets.

Let's begin...

→ Realism & Abstraction
"Hyper Real" or "Hyperrealistic" - An over-the-top version of the default "realism" [horror or caricatures].

"Magic Realism" - A realistic idea with natural & surreal elements [dream or fantasy].

"Fantastic Realism" - Modern style paired with mind-bending elements [dream or horror].

"Contemporary Realism" or "New Realism" - High-skill painting style [people or dramatic scenes].

"Surreal" or "Surrealism" - An unreasonable, and often contradictory, representation of the unconscious mind [weird or creepy].

"Ethereal" or "Ethereality" or "Lucid" - Light and delicate perfection/utopia style [spiritual creatures, characters, or environments].

"Fiction" or "Science Fiction" - Imaginative and futuristic concepts [technology, space, anything].

"Imagined" or "Imaginative" or "Imagination" - New ideas, images, or concepts that may not be real [animals, otherworldly, or strange].

"Dreamlike" or "Dreamy" or "Fever-Dream" - Similar to "Imagination" but has more "Ethereal" aspects [afterlife, spiritual, or lofty].

"Dreampunk" - Steampunk aesthetic mixed with "Dreamlike" with hints of futurism [technology or vintage].

"Dreamcore" or "Weirdcore" - A surrealist aesthetic paired with low-quality assets [memes, creepy, or trippy].

"Otherworldly" or "Unworldly" or "Another Realm" - Imaginary or spiritual world [space, futuristic, or landscapes].

"Abstract" or "Abstraction" - Images that communicate through lines, shapes, colors, and form rather than solid ideas [backgrounds, modern design, logos].

"Fantasy" or "Ethereal Fantasy" or "Dark Fantasy" - A broad and loosely defined art that pulls from magic, mythological, and supernatural ideas [beings, gods, or landscapes].

"Illusion" or "Impossible" - An idea with a warped reality [dreams, optical, or strange].

"Exaggerated" or "Exaggeration" or "Visual Exaggeration" - Similar to "Hyper-Realism" but less emphasis on the realism aspect [emotions or extremes].

"Immaterial" or "Intangible" - Similar to "Abstract" art but less modernized [smoke, lines, or objects].

# Midjourney v5 Color Tips

This is the ultimate guide to getting the perfect color in Midjourney - let's get started...

→ Work with broad general color palettes like, autumn colors, winter colors, cold colors, warm colors, vibrant colors, muted colors, tropical colors.

→ Remove colors using negative weights OR create dominant colors by giving them positive weights. 

For example, "red::2 a small creek divides a vast meadow" will add a red cast to the whole image.

→ Write normally about color and use rerolls and v-rolls to create permutations until the colors sort themselves out.  

For example, "a blonde blue-eyed queen wearing a brocade green and gold gown" might work instantly or need you to 🔃 reroll or guide Midjourney by using v-roll grid selections.

→ If you're not much of a color expert, you should check out three of my favorite online tools [a quick Google Search will get you there:
1. Coolors - Generate A Custom Color Palette 
2. ImageColorPicker - Find HEX Color Codes From An Image
3. ColorNamer - Use HEX Color Codes To Find Color Names

→ You can even ask ChatGPT - here are a few prompts to get you started:
- name ten shades of [insert color]
- name ten pastel shades of [insert color]
- name ten [insert season] colors
- name ten popular [insert art style] colors

→ Colors are not easily assigned to all objects, but if your prompt pretends the object is made of a particular material, the color can sometimes be invoked [see Handheld Objects Tips 📚 to learn about "invoking"].

Invoking may require some creativity on your part, but the following examples will help reframe your thinking:

→ Materials To Invoke Eye Color:
Diamond - Clear/Blue
Ruby - Red
Sapphire - Blue
Emerald - Green
Amethyst - Purple

→ Materials To Invoke Clothing Colors:
Cotton: White / Off-White
Wool: Grey, Brown, OR Black
Silk: Gold, Silver, OR Pastel Shades
Leather: Brown, Black, OR Tan
Flax: Natural / Beige

→ Materials To Invoke Liquid Colors:
Water: Clear
Milk: White
Wine: Red
Juice: Orange
Beer: Amber
Cola: Brown
Lemonade: Yellow
Blue Curacao: Blue
Pepto-Bismol: Pink
Antifreeze: Bright Green

→ Materials To Invoke Fantasy Colors:
Iron Oxide: Black, Yellow, OR Brown
Carbon: Black
Charcoal: Black
Indigo: Blue
Henna: Reddish Brown
Cochineal: Red
Carnelian: Red
Ochre: Yellow, Orange, OR Red
Kaolin: White
Saffron: Yellow

→ If you're still not getting the color you want, you can try the color scheme method. This is when you prompt for whole color palettes and 🔃 reroll until you see the permutation you're after or one that appeals to you even more. 

→ And if all else fails, you can try using a reference image to give Midjourney better direction. 

The best way to do this is to upscale & save a MJ output image that is closest to what you want design-wise. 

Then, take it into Photoshop or another third-party tool to edit the color. 

Finally, use the edited image as a reference image with the origin prompt to, hopefully, get the desired color.

# Midjourney v5 Camera Control Tips


Adding the following phrases to your prompt may help change the camera zoom and/or angle of your generated image:

→ Camera Far Away 🔭
"Wide-Angle Shot" or "Wide-Angle" - The camera is far away from the subject.

"Ultra-Wide Angle" or "Ultra Wide-Angle" - The camera is very far away from the subject.

"Far-Shot" or "Far-Angle" - The camera is far away from the subject and below or above it.

"Aerial View" or "Satellite View" or "Drone Footage" - The camera is far away looking down on the subject.

→ Camera Medium Distance 👀
"Medium-Shot" or "Medium-Shot Angle"  - The camera is low, looking up at the subject.

"Top-Down Shot" or "Top-Down Angle" - The camera is high, looking down at the subject.

"Ground-Shot" or "Ground-Shot Angle" or "Ground Angle" - The camera is high, looking down at the subject.

"Low-Angle Shot" or "Low Angle" - The camera is very low, looking way up at the subject.

"High-Angle Shot" or "High Angle" - The camera is fairly high, looking down at the subject.

"Full-Shot" or "Full-Body Shot" or "Full-Length Shot" - The camera captures the entire subject.

"Dutch-Angle" or "Dutch Tilt" or "Canted Angle" - The whole shot is slanted/diagonal with a horror-esque vibe.

→ Camera Close Up 🔍
"Eye-Level Shot" - The camera is fairly close and looking levelly at the subject

"Close-Up - The camera is close to the subject.

"Glamour Shot" or "Glamour Portrait" - The camera is intimately close to the subject.

"Macro-Shot" or "Macrophotography" - The camera is extremely close to the subject.

The phrases above are more influential when they appear closer to the beginning of the prompt OR at the very end.

# Midjourney v5 Reference Image Tips

You can use images as part of a prompt to influence a job's composition, style, and colors. 

Images prompts can be used alone or with text prompts — experiment with combining images with different styles for the most exciting results.

→ To add images to a prompt, type or paste the web address where the image is stored online. 

The address must end in an extension like .png, .gif, or .jpg. 

After adding image addresses, add any additional text and parameters to complete the prompt.

Example: /imagine [image URL] [your prompt]

Pro Tip: You can upload your images to Discord, right click, and copy the image link OR for increased privacy, you can direct message the image to the Midjourney Bot to prevent other users from seeing the image.

→ If you don't want Midjourney to blend your reference image(s) using its own rules, then you can write a prompt for the output you want to see. 

In --v 5 you can increase the influence of your reference image using "--iw N" where N is a value between 0.5 and 2. The default is 1.0 so if you want your image reference to be less influential, try --iw 0.5 and if you want it to be very influential try --iw 2.  

Note: The output won't look exactly like the input. Reference image(s) are only influences, so you will not (for example) be able to recreate the exact likeness of you or your loved ones.

→ Recommendations: 

- Play with the value of --iw between 0.5 and 2 to modify the influence of the reference images. 

All images will have the weight specified here - you can't give them different values.

- Play with the value of --stylize [--s] between 0 and 1000 to turn down (or up) the influence of Midjourney's house style. 

The lower value is likely to create more likeness to the reference.

- The URL of your reference image(s) MUST end in an image filename extension such as png, jpg, gif.

- Strive to use the same aspect ratio for inputs as you'd like as output: 1:1 in for 1:1 out. 2:3 for 2:3 out, etc. 

Otherwise, you may run into issues with borders.

- Reference images should be simple. Clear subjects, uncomplicated backgrounds.

- One reference image will not work without a text prompt, but multiple reference images will work without a text prompt.

- Use multiple reference images of the subject to increase the accuracy of the generation.

- Image refs work best if they already represent roughly what you want to see in the final image. 

A running figure will be easier to render as running than a standing one. The pose will carry over.

- MJ will always create a brand new image, never a copy - you can't recreate the source image. 

You'll only get rough likenesses of the people in the pictures.

- Midjourney will NOT invent/add/create all by itself. You must prompt for it. 

A reference image that does not include arms will continue to not have arms, unless your prompt mentions arms, i.e. sleeves, biceps, or bracelets.

- Use 🔃 reroll before giving up.

# Midjourney v5 Parameter Tips

Parameters are options added to the end of a prompt that change how an image generates. 

Parameters can change an image's aspect ratio, switch between model versions, and much more.

Let's talk about what parameters work with v5, and how you can use them in your own prompts:

→ Aspect Ratios

The "--aspect" or "--ar" parameter changes the aspect ratio of the generated image. 

An aspect ratio is the width-to-height ratio of an image. It is typically expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, such as 7:4 or 4:3.

For example, if you wanted a YouTube thumbnail, you would use "--ar 16:9". 

With v5, you can use an aspect ratio of any size, but images greater than 2:1 may produce unpredictable results.

→ Chaos

The "--chaos" or "--c" parameter influences how varied the initial image grids are. 

High chaos values will produce more unusual and unexpected results, while lower chaos values have more reliable, repeatable results.

You can input chaos values between 0-100 with "--chaos 0" being the default setting.

→ Image Weight

Using image weight "--iw" only makes when you're using image and text prompts at the same time.

If you want your image to have more influence on the final generation, you would increase your weight.

"--iw 0.5" is the default weight for v5, but you could increase it up to "--iw 2".

Example: 
"[image link] vibrant landscape --iw 0.5" = low image influence

"[image link] vibrant landscape --iw 2" = high image influence

→ No

You would use "--no" when you're trying to remove certain details/imperfections from your generations.

For example, "--no text" would try to remove text from the image [although this doesn't always work].

→ Quality

The "--quality" or "--q" parameter changes how much time is spent generating an image. 

Higher-quality settings take longer to process and produce more details. Higher values also mean more GPU minutes are used per job. 

However, the quality setting DOES NOT impact resolution.

The default quality is 1 [base quality], but you can change it to .25 [quarter quality] or .5 [half quality].

→ Seed

Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the "--seed" or "--sameseed" parameter. 

You can find an image you'd like to use on the Midjourney website and copy its' seed code.

Then, when you enter your prompt, you would use the seed code like this, "--seed [input copied seed number]"

→ Stop

Use the "--stop" parameter to finish a job partway through the process. 

Stopping a job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.

Example: "--stop 50" will halt the generation at 50% completion.

→ Stylize

The "--stylize" or "--s" parameter influences how strong MJ training is applied. 

Low stylization values produce images closer to the prompt, while higher stylization creates artsy images less connected to the prompt.

The default for v5 is "--s 100", but you can change it to anything between the range of 0-1000.

→ Tile

The "--tile" parameter generates images that can be used as repeating tiles to create seamless patterns for fabrics, wallpapers, and textures.

Example: "koi fish pond --tile"

The parameters are constantly shifting, but hopefully this guide helps shine a light on how to use parameters for your future generations.

# Midjourney v5 Punctuation Tips

The best recommendation I can make is to use punctuation the way you learned in school.

With that being said, for troubleshooting or resolving issues, the following information may be useful:

The only punctuation Midjourney understands is:
- Double-Hyphens
- Double-Colons
- Spaces

Double-Hyphen, also known as em dash, delimits parameters. e.g. "--ar 16:9" or "--v 5"

Double-Colon delimits integers (positive and negative) for weights. e.g. "::-0.5"

Spaces are used as the de facto character to separate tokens.

What about [ ]? 
What about / /? 
What about ( )?  

If the punctuation is NOT one of the three mentioned at the top of this list, then it's not functional. 

It's noise. 

However, noise is a fascinating tool for sculpting images. 

No, it doesn't mean what humans think it means, but it's definitely part of the artistic toolbox. 

→ Does [ ], { }, / /, ; ;, or ( ) do anything? 

The answer is that they are doing something, but the only way to describe it is "noise."

Midjourney is not programmed to know anything special about commas, hyphens, or brackets, but since humans use them, it's recommended that you use them in your prompts. 

They may have good correlations in the data set.

→ The correct use of commas is recommended to help people understand their own token grouping, just like it does in ordinary writing.

No – Midjourney DOES NOT know what a comma is, but humans do, and people who use commas in their prompts seem to have a better time crafting and understanding their prompting. 

Therefore, you can technically use any character you like, but commas make sense, and so may be better correlated.

"Ornate shadowed massive sentient" may be improved by writing it "Ornate, shadowed, massive, sentient"

→ Sometimes, when troubleshooting, hyphenation may increase the relationship between tokens. 

No – Midjourney DOES NOT know what a hyphen is, but humans do! 

 "Antique brass candlestick"  may be improved by writing it "Brass-antique-candlestick"

Ultimately, anything outside of double-hyphens, double-colons, and spaces TRULY doesn't matter.

It is up to you, the prompter, to decide what prompt structure works best to generate the idea you have in mind.

# Midjourney v5 Camera Lenses & Lens Filters

Adding the following phrases to your prompt may help change or enhance the quality of your generated image:

→ Camera Lenses 
"15mm" - An ultra-wide lens that captures a wide field of view [perfect for landscape or architecture]

"35mm" - A standard lens with a natural perspective similar to human vision [ideal for street-shots or general use]

"85mm" - A medium telephoto lens with a narrow field of view that creates beautiful bokeh [out-of-focus areas] and isolates the subject from the background [great for portrait and low-light settings]

"100mm" - A medium telephoto lens that provides a longer working distance for macro photography [perfect for capturing detailed close-ups of small subjects]

"200mm" - A telephoto lens that provides a narrow field of view and magnifies distant subjects [great for sports, wildlife, or events where the subject is far away]

→ Lens Filters
"Color-Gel" - Modifies the color temperature or creates a specific color effect. 

Example: "Blue color-gel filter" to cool down a warm light generation or "red color-gel filter" to warm up a cool light generation.

"Diffusion-Filter" - Softens the image and reduces contrast to create a dreamy or romantic effect.

Example: "Soft focus filter" for portraits or "diffusion filter" for nature.

"Polarization-Filter" or "Polarizer Lens" - Reduces glare, reflections, and enhances color saturation by controlling the direction of light waves. 

Example: "Circular polarizer filter" for landscapes or "linear polarizer filter" for removing reflections from glass surfaces.

"Dichroic-Filter" - Separates light into different wavelengths to create a color separation effect.

Example: "Prism filter" for creating rainbow effects or "star filter" for creating sparkling lights.

"Neutral-Density-Filter" or "ND-Filter" - Reduces the amount of light entering the lens without affecting color balance. 

Example: Capturing flowing water or creating motion blur in bright daylight.

"Infrared-Filter" or "Infared-Cut-Off-Filter" - Blocks visible light and allows infrared light to pass through to create a surreal or eerie effect. 

Example: "Infrared filter" for landscapes or "night vision filter" for security cameras.

"Graduated-Neutral-Density-Filter" or "GND-Filter" - Reduces the exposure of a specific area of the image, usually the sky, to balance it with the rest of the image. 

Example: Balancing the exposure between a bright sky and a darker foreground in landscape shots.

"Ultraviolet-Filter" or "UV-Filter" - Blocks ultraviolet light and protects the lens from dust, scratches, and fingerprints. 

Example: "UV filter" for protecting the lens in outdoor photography or "Haze filter" for reducing atmospheric haze in landscape generations.

→ Space Filters
"Astronomical-Filter" - The general term to enhances colors of light emitted by celestial objects, such as stars or planets. 

"Oxygen-III filter" - Capturing the blue-green emission nebula in astrophotography. 

"Hydrogen-Alpha Filter" - Isolates the red emission line of hydrogen atoms emitted by nebulae and regions of ionized hydrogen gas.

"Light-Pollution-Reduction-Filter" - Blocks specific wavelengths of light associated with artificial light pollution, allowing clearer images of the night sky to be captured from light-polluted areas.

"Broadband Nebula Filter" - Enhances the contrast of emission nebulae by blocking unwanted light and enhancing the transmission of specific wavelengths of light associated with nebular emissions.

The phrases above are more influential when they appear closer to the beginning of the prompt OR at the very end.

Pro Tip: Ask ChatGPT about what lens filter would work best with your prompt.

# Midjourney v5 Camera & Film Type Tips

Adding the following keywords and styles to your prompt may help change the overall effect of your generated image...

P.S. This thread will contain examples of each camera/film type in the order they are listed.

→ Camera & Film Types 🎥
"Camcorder" - Adds film grain, noise, and saturation similar to a VHS tape [good for 90s vintage look].

"DSLR" - Better resolution, sharpness, and clarity [good for modern look].

"GoPro" or "GoPro Video" - Fish-eye effect typically in the form of a selfie [cool for action shots].

"Disposable Camera" - Fixed-focus with 35mm lens [good for portraits].

"Polaroid" - High black point and faded [good for faded memories].

"Fujifilm Superia" - High performance, high speed color negative film with fine-grain [good for snapshots or action shots].

"Instax" - Daylight color film with high gloss [good for hipster memories].

"Kodak Ektar" - Subtle retro hues or poppy contrast [good for high-detail black and white].

"Kodak Gold 200" - Crisp and clear for bright, sunny days [good for "golden hour" and natural light generations].

"Kodak Portra" - Vivid film that captures colors, light, and textures in crisp format [good for nature shots or light fog].

"Velvia" - High saturation film [good for landscape photography or nature].

"Lomo" - Oversaturated, high contrast, and soft blur [good for a rustic look].

"CinemaScope" - An old filming technique for 2.35:1 aspect ratio [good for widescreen shots].

"Kodak 400TX" or "Tri-X 400TX" - Fine grain black and white images [good for a mixture of modern quality with retro vibes].

"VistaVision" - High-resolution widescreen with 35mm film [good for old-school Hollywood shots].

"Technirama" - Doubled resolution over anamorphic 35mm film [all three original Star Wars films used a Technirama camera for effects photography].

"Tintype" - Direct positive imprinted on a thin sheet of metal coated with a dark lacquer or enamel [good for super vintage look]

"Calotype" or "Talbotype" - Paper coated with silver iodide [again, good for super vintage look]

"Ambrotype" - Underexposed glass negative placed against a dark background [again, super vintage].

"Daguerreotype" - Highly detailed image on a sheet of copper plated with a thin coat of silver without using a negative [again, old af].

In order for certain camera/film types to work, you may need to change your prompt around and adjust how you mention the camera/film.

For example, "camcorder effect" or "VHS effect" or "camcorder video" or "shot with a camcorder" may all work or one or none.

# Midjourney v5 Prompting Tips

In v5, to generate something other than a photographic image, you will need to reference art movements, artistic techniques, genres, media types, games titles, directors, artist names, influences, time periods, etc. 

To create an aesthetic, try referencing two or more of these:

→ Art movement: Identifying the art movement in the prompt will introduce its style and techniques. 

Examples: “Impressionism”, “Surrealism”, or “Pop Art”.

→ Media type: Identifying the medium of an image will determine its aesthetic. 

Examples: photography, illustration, comic, concept art, storyboard, sculpture, etc.

→ Media title: Identifying a media influence will influence its look. 

Examples: “from Spirited Away” or “from The Wizard of Oz” or “from Sid Meier's Civilization” or “from the video game Joust”.

→ Artist name: Referencing the name or the work of a specific artist will roughly invoke their unique style. 

Examples: “Vincent Van Gogh”, “Frida Kahlo”, or “Banksy”.

→ Technique: Referencing techniques will add that style to the image. 

Examples: “impasto”, “pencil sketch”, “watercolor”, or “digital art”.

→ Time period: Identifying the historical context of an image will invoke its aesthetic.

Examples: “Renaissance”, “Baroque”, or “Modernist” periods.

→ Geographic location: Referencing regions and countries will influence style.

Examples: “Japanese Ukiyo-e prints”, “African tribal art”, or “American Abstract Expressionism”.

Photography requires the least memory, so it's the system default. 

It's what shows up if the artist (that's you or me) does not specify any other styling.

# Midjourney v5 Handheld Objects Tips

Let's use weapons as an example, since that's asked about most often. 

You may be writing a prompt like "A man wearing furs and leather holding a wooden club".  

This prompt method is called "describing". 

→ The other way to go about it is called "invoking" – when you invoke the character stereotype and let MJ decide the rest. 

What type of man would be covered in fur and carrying a club? 

A barbarian by change?

Let's say he's a barbarian. To invoke MJ, I'd name his stereotype and only minimally describe him. 

Example: "Dungeons & Dragons character portrait, a tribal barbarian with massive wooden club, leather suede boots, arm tattoos, 2D game art, concept art, Disney, Pixar"

→ Archetypes (stereotypes, clichés) that have weapons will naturally hold weapons:

Knights, swordsmen, guardians, barbarians, bandits, archers, rangers, samurai, vikings, etc.

→ Archetypes that have wands will naturally hold wands:

Mages, magicians, wizards, enchantress, warlocks, etc.

→ Archetypes that typically have books will naturally have books:

Librarians, teachers, scholars, professors, etc.

→ The idea is to call your model by its stereotype [or archetype] in the prompt, and let the stereotype do all the work to invoke what they are holding.

Your prompt may not even have to include "holding whatever it is", because the archetype is always depicted holding it! 

In other cases, you can reinforce its appearance by mentioning it.

→ QUESTION - I did this, but my character appears to be holding some sort of thingamajig that isn't the object I specified. What do I do?

It's time to learn the slider method! 

This is when you create a promptlet out of an exact phrase in your main prompt, and give it a virtual "slider" you can adjust to increase/decrease influence. 

→ For this to work, you need a main prompt that is all ONE string/sentence/statement. 

If your main prompt already has weights in it, this method won't work.

Example of using a "slider":
Dungeons & Dragons character portrait, a tribal barbarian with massive wooden club, beaded suede boots, arm tattoos, 2D game art, concept art, Disney, Pixar:: massive broadsword in his hand::0.5 --ar 16:9

→ Issues like this sometimes pop up when you're asking a stereotype to hold something it almost never holds. 

Example: A secretary with a broadsword or a mage with a modern cellphone. 

In these case you might want to avoid using the word 'secretary' or 'mage' so those words aren't fighting with the non-stereotypical object they're holding. 

In these cases, describe someone who looks a little like a secretary (or a mage) without using the actual word. 

You might also use the slider method to get it the rest of the way there.

# Midjourney v5 Body Type & Ethnicity Tips

There are a handful of methods you can use to depict diverse characters. 

Apply the following methods in tandem with proper vocabulary to create the types of people you're looking for...

→ Vocabulary

The easiest method is to explore how word choice affects your image, and keep adjusting until you find the right word, or phrase, that generates any decent example of the characteristic. 

For example, let's say you wanted to create a plus-sized model. Using the word "obese" may make the character too big, while using the term "pudgy" makes them too small.

I recommend asking ChatGPT for some alternate word options or using an online thesaurus.

→ The Slider Method

If you don't want to keep repeating the prompt with slightly different word variations, you can use the slider method to fix your model.

This method requires you to increase OR decrease the item weight to make micro-adjustments to the output image.

Example: 
- "plus-sized female dressed in sundress:: plus-sized:: 0.5" = a very large woman 
- "plus-sized female dressed in sundress" = a large woman
- "plus sized female dressed in sundress:: plus-sized:: -0.3" = a less large woman

Now you can create a new /imagine with the new slider value to adjust the character's appearance. 

Or if you really like one of the images in the grid and don't want to lose it, you can upscale it, remix it, and adjust the slider value. 

P.S. In order to "remix" an image, you have to turn it on in your settings by typing "/settings" and clicking/tapping "Remix mode".

→ Archetypes

Archetypes help you invoke a character's basic appearance. 

For example, if your character is in a modern setting, you could use words like "disabled" or "handicapped" to create images of individuals using wheelchairs or other assisted-movement devices. 

You can also use cultural, ethnic, and national terms to invoke skin color, but I've found the easiest way to get the ethnicity/body-type you're looking for is to use emoji flags.

Examples: 🇮🇪  🇨🇦 🇦🇺 🇺🇸 🇲🇽

→ WARNING

You need to be careful to avoid "offensive language" when crafting these prompts because too many violations may get your account temporarily, or permanently, locked.

# Midjourney v5 New Feature Tips


Midjourney recently unveiled its new "/describe" function, which allows users to generate prompts based on existing images. 

With this feature, you can upload an image and receive four text prompts that describe it, which you can then use to generate images for each prompt.

You could try the feature in the following ways:

→ Social Media Marketing
Generate artwork that aligns with your brand's aesthetic and messaging by uploading images that convey your brand's values or personality and generating prompts that suggest visual concepts for your social media content.

→ Product Design
Generate artwork that inspires new product designs or packaging concepts by uploading images of existing products or competitors' products and generating prompts that suggest new design elements or packaging ideas.

→ Storytelling
Generate artwork that inspires new stories or characters by uploading images that evoke a particular mood or setting and generating prompts that suggest new plot points or character traits.

→ Artists
Generate new ideas, explore images in different ways, collaborate with other artists, and create new artwork to add to your portfolio by using the prompts provided by the feature.

→ Music
Generate artwork that inspires new album covers or music videos by uploading images that convey a particular tone or emotion and generating prompts that suggest visual concepts for your music.

→ Fashion Design
Generate artwork that inspires new clothing designs or fabric patterns by uploading images of textiles or existing clothing designs and generating prompts that suggest new color schemes or patterns.

→ Interior Design
Generate artwork that complements a particular color scheme, texture, or theme in a room by uploading an image of the space you are designing and generating prompts that match the design elements you want to emphasize.

→ Education
Generate artwork that helps students visualize abstract concepts or historical events by uploading images related to the subject you are teaching and generating prompts that suggest visual representations of the concepts you want to convey.

Overall, the /describe feature is a helpful addition for users looking for inspiration or fresh prompts from their own work.

# Midjourney v5 [More] New Features

The two latest features dropped a few hours ago, and they have the potential to generate a massive number of jobs with minimal input.

WARNING: The following features are limited to Pro Members at this time.⚠️

→ Repeat

This prompting feature that allows users to run a specific job multiple times by using the "--repeat" command followed by a number.

This feature is particularly useful when you want to generate several variations or iterations of a specific idea or concept. 

For example, if you want to create five 2x2 grids of Darth Vader images, you would use the command:

"/imagine Darth Vader --repeat 5". 

This can streamline your generation process and help you save time when exploring multiple variations of a particular idea.

→ Permutations

This is another advanced prompting feature that enables users to create numerous jobs with varying combinations of words. 

It's particularly useful when you want to explore different combinations of ideas or concepts in an efficient and organized manner. 

To use the Permutations feature, you use curly brackets { } to enclose the words or phrases you want to combine and separate them with commas.

Example:

/imagine a {sunny, rainy, snowy} {park, beach, mountain}

The Permutations feature will generate all possible combinations:

/imagine a sunny park
/imagine a rainy park
/imagine a snowy park
/imagine a sunny beach
/imagine a rainy beach
/imagine a snowy beach
/imagine a sunny mountain
/imagine a rainy mountain
/imagine a snowy mountain

→ "Nested" Permutations

You can even nest curly brackets within other curly brackets to create more complex combinations.

Example:

/imagine A {photo, sketch} of a {cat {on a tree, in a box}, rabbit {in a field, under a bush}}.

The Permutations feature will generate all possible combinations:

/imagine A photo of a cat on a tree.
/imagine A photo of a cat in a box.
/imagine A photo of a rabbit in a field.
/imagine A photo of a rabbit under a bush.
/imagine A sketch of a cat on a tree.
/imagine A sketch of a cat in a box.
/imagine A sketch of a rabbit in a field.
/imagine A sketch of a rabbit under a bush.

Note: All of these 'batch' operations are limited to 40 jobs [past that and MJ will discard them] and will process up to 16 at a time.
