---
- When your outfit has layers (like a sweater under a jacket) you'll want to arrange them in your prompt from the outside in. MJ gives more weight to items placed earlier in the prompt. Since the peacoat is the dominant piece here, we want to put it before the turtleneck.

- [weather] - I used "its raining and raindrops splashing on the water" so I have a more blueish tone. Then switched to "sunset reflecting on the lake" - this gave me a more warm tone with the sun hitting the water

- [camera angle] - while I loved "close up portrait" the most I also used "wide angle" , "top down shot" and non camera mention. Prompts in ALT.

10. Exploring Atmosphere, Color Blending, and Combo Commands
- Combo commands aren't always needed, but they're often useful. Anything you can do to increase the coherence of the image to your prompt is valuable, especially if integrating MJ into a production workflow. Reliable outputs are key, & combo commands help boost your consistency

https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1646307628304437248
---
- When prompting for things like smoke, mist, or fog in Midjourney, I use two things for greater control: 1- Combo Commands (see next tweet) 2- Specific lighting

* Street style, medium-full photo shot on Agfa Vista 200 of a young french woman with long blonde hair and rosy cheeks, walking, wearing a yellow/orange Gingham print summer dress, blue background mist, extremely misty background, misty purple background atmosphere, blue & purple backlit mist, misty late-night, soho --ar 16:9

- A Combo Command is when you combine multiple variations of a single idea in order to reinforce it in your prompt and help Midjourney understand the intention of a key variable(s).

* Street style photo shot on Agfa Vista 200 of a young woman, wearing a yellow nylon jacket & blue oxford shirt, misty background, backlight, late-night, soho --ar 16:9
* Street style photo shot on Agfa Vista 200 of a young woman, wearing a yellow nylon jacket & blue oxford shirt, background mist, misty background, misty background atmosphere, backlit mist, misty late-night, soho --ar 16:9

- Example Combo Command

* Street style photo shot on Agfa Vista 200 of a young woman, wearing a yellow nylon jacket & blue oxford shirt, red & purple background smoke, backlight, late-night, soho --ar 16:9
* Street style photo shot on Agfa Vista 200 of a young woman, wearing a yellow nylon jacket & blue oxford shirt, red & purple background smoke, red & purple backlit smoke, late-night, soho --ar 16:9

https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1646307681978974210
---
- Benefits of Combo Commands: 1- More consistent outputs 2- More coherent color assignments 3- Color blending w/ minimal impact on other items in your scene, such as the model's clothing.

* Street style photo shot on Agfa Vista 200 of a young woman, wearing a yellow nylon jacket & blue oxford shirt, red background smoke, smokey background, smokey purple background atmosphere, purple & red backlit smoke, late-night, soho --ar 16:9
* Street style photo shot on Agfa Vista 200 of a young woman, wearing a yellow nylon jacket & blue oxford shirt, green background smoke, smokey background, smokey blue background atmosphere, green & blue backlit smoke, late-night, soho --ar 16:9
* Street style photo shot on Agfa Vista 200 of a young woman, wearing a yellow nylon jacket & blue oxford shirt, orange background smoke, smokey pink background, smokey pink background atmosphere, orange & pink backlit smoke, late-night, soho --ar 16:9

- Midjourney also does a great job distinguishing between particle sizes of similar conditions. (Misty, Smokey)

12. Lights and Shadows
* Extreme close-up portrait of a beautiful woman, pale skin, deep blue eyes. The lighting is natural and soft, with the sun shining down on her face. The shot is framed in such a way that the shadow of a fence falls across her face, creating a dynamic interplay of light and shadow. This adds depth and texture to the photo. --ar 2:3 --s 650

* Extreme close-up portrait of a beautiful woman, pale skin, white dyed mane hair, her face is lit solely from down below by a spotlight, creating a striking contrast of light and shadow, chiaroscuro style. The lighting is dramatic, highlighting the contours of the woman's face and adding depth and texture to the photo. The shot is taken at a slight angle, adding a sense of movement and dynamism. Volumetric lighting, high contrast. --ar 2:3 --s 500

* Extreme close-up portrait of a beautiful woman, pale skin, green eyes, black hair. The lighting is natural and soft, with the sun shining down on her face.

Volumetric lighting, high contrast, chiaroscuro --ar 2:3 --s 550

- Quick Look at Midjourney Prompt Structure

- How to arrange your prompt variables to better control your image generations, from basic prompts to advanced prompts.

https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1648052447854891008

---

- How Midjourney understands prompts 👇

- MJ breaks down words and phrases into smaller pieces, called tokens, that are then compared to its training data and used to generate an image.

- A well-structured prompt will help MJ better understand what you're looking for.

https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1648052455752761344

---

- The Basic Prompt 👇

- A word, phrase, emoji, a letter. Pretty much anything will work. Keep in mind that the shorter the prompt, the more influence each word has.

- A short 3-4 word prompt can still generate unique images, depending on how descriptive the words are (see next tweet)

https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1648052462140690432

---
- Here are some 2-word prompt examples that help demonstrate the impact a single descriptive word can have on your image generations.

- Country Movie (top left)
- Country Gucci (top right)
- Country Music (bottom left)
- Country Landscape (bottom right)

https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1648052524912644097

---

- Building your prompt 👇

- I always recommend starting with the basic concept first and seeing what you get. It will help you better understand how MJ is interpreting your concept and makes it easier for you to then add in specific variables and tune the image to your liking.

https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1648052532743225345
---

- Advanced Prompting 👇

- Moving beyond your basic idea, an advanced prompt is one that elaborates on the composition details and utilizes parameters for more control over image generations.

- Below are some example variables you might include in an advanced photography prompt.

https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1648052542809739264
---

- How I structure my prompts 👇

- I front load my prompt with the style, composition, and camera details, followed by the subject & subject details, then the environment, lighting, atmosphere, and mood. Parameters like aspect ratio and seed are always at the end.

https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1648052547180175360
---
In general, MJ tends to place more importance on things earlier in the prompt, or at the beginning of a phrase.

Keep this in mind as you play around with the order of your variables. The change you need might be changing the order/placement of a single word or phrase.
