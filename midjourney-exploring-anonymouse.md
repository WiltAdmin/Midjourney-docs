# Photographers📸- Midjourney

If you're looking to add a unique touch to your photographs and give them a specific style and atmosphere, try adding a photographer's name to your prompt.

Since photographers have direct and immediate control over the visual elements of a photo, such as lighting, composition, and color grading, and their work is often immediately recognizable by these elements in a single image, adding their name in a prompt will often have a significant effect on the images generated by Midjourney.

Let’s talk about a little experiment I made.

First, I generated a series of 4 images with a simple prompt:

"A woman sitting on a park bench".

The images generated were completely random, with no artistic direction.

Using the seed of the first generation of images, I used the same prompt and added the name of a famous photographer:

📷Annie Leibovitz

"A woman sitting on a park bench in the style of Annie Leibovitz".

While I have a basic understanding of photography, I'm far from an expert. So, I asked ChatGPT to describe to me what a photo of a woman sitting on a park bench taken by Annie Leibovitz might look like. 

Here are some elements of the answer:

→The lighting would likely be dramatic, with strong contrasts between light and shadow.

→The woman may be wearing a stylish and unique outfit, possibly a tailored coat or trench coat.

→Her expression would likely be contemplative or reflective, with a hint of vulnerability.

→The woman may appear to be middle-aged or older.

→The colors in the image may be desaturated, with a focus on earth tones.

→The background would be carefully selected and may feature natural elements, such as trees or foliage.

→Overall, the image would exude a sense of depth, emotion, and artistry, characteristic of Annie Leibovitz's style.

Almost all of those elements were present in the photography, at diverse levels!

I invite you to try it yourself.

You can also use some of ChatGPT's descriptions and integrate them into your prompts.

Since Annie Leibovitz is especially recognized for her magnificent portraits, adding here name in a prompt to generate a portrait should have a more significant impact on the result.

To test it, I started again from a simple prompt:

"A portrait photography of a woman".

From this prompt, I got similar random results, without any artistic vision. By adding "in the style of Annie Leibovitz", the generated images were automatically imbued with her style.

You could almost swear that she took the picture herself! 

Well, I'm exaggerating a bit but the result was surprising and even more consistent with her style because it was a portrait.

You can be even more precise by adding to your prompt the name of a camera, lens, and details about settings similar to those that Annie Leibovitz would have used for a portrait.

If you're not a photography expert, you can ask ChatGPT for more details on this. That is something I do all the time and it helps a lot!

I did a similar experiment with📷Edward Weston, a photographer among others recognized for his magnificent photos of mushrooms.

Prompts 1:

"A photograph of a mushroom"

Prompts 2:

"A photograph of a mushroom in the style of Edward Weston"

Prompts 3:

"A photograph of a mushroom in the style of Edward Weston taken in 1931"

In the third prompt, I added the date the picture was taken. This is a very effective little trick to get an image even more tinged with the photographer's style.

Here is a short description of Weston's photo (Toadstool, 1931) as given by chat-GPT:

"The image is characterized by its strong contrast between the dark background and the lighter tones of the toadstool, which makes the mushroom stand out and draws the viewer's attention. The lighting and tonal range in the photograph emphasize the texture and form of the toadstool, giving it an almost sculptural quality"

Try it yourself, the results are very consistent with this description! It is really surprising!

The result of these two experiments really amazed me! In the future, I will use the names of famous photographers more often in my prompts to get special artistic touches.

However, adding a photographer's name to a prompt is not the only guarantee of a magnificent result (several other aspects need to be considered such as how to structure your prompt, the words used, camera angles, etc.) but it is clear that it has a significant positive influence on the images generated with Midjourney.

I think it's a great way to learn more about photography and to experiment with new ideas and styles.

I've made a list of some of the greatest photographers of all time so you can have something you can refer to quickly. Obviously, this list is not complete, but it is a good starting point.

Hope you’ll find it useful!

# Angles & Shots🎥- Midjourney 

Camera angles and shot types are two different aspects of cinematography and photography that work together to create a desired visual effect. They each serve a unique purpose in the composition and storytelling of an image or scene.

The two aspects can sometimes be confusing, so here is a short helpful description:

→Camera angles refer to the position of the camera relative to the subject and the angle at which the camera is pointed.

→Shot types describe how a subject appears in a picture or scene, mainly influenced by how close or far the camera is from them.

Knowing and understanding how to use these elements plays a crucial role and positively impacts the realism, harmony, and coherence of your creations.

I have done several tests with Midjourney and I want to share them with you.

Here is a detailed list of the most commonly used camera angles and shot types in cinema and photography, with some of my personal comments. 

I hope it will be as useful to you as it is to me in your creative explorations!

→ Camera Angles📐

🎥Eye-level: A neutral camera angle that is approximately at the subject's eye level, creating a natural perspective.

NOTE:

I tested 3 different ways of integrating angles and shot types into a simple prompt to see which produced the most consistent results:

- Eye-level shot of a woman standing in front of her house

- A woman (eye-level shot) standing in front of her house

- A woman standing in front of her house, Eye-level shot

According to my experiments, the first way is significantly the most consistent of the three. This applies to all other types of camera angles and shot types.

But, feel free to experiment, there is more than one way to write a prompt!

For a reason I am unaware of, using the term "shot" as in "Eye-level shot of a woman" rather than "angle" yields far better results.

🎥Low-angle: A camera angle that looks up at the subject from a lower position, often making the subject appear more dominant or powerful.

🎥High-angle: A camera angle that looks down at the subject from a higher position, often making the subject appear smaller or less significant.

🎥Dutch angle (or canted angle or tilted angle): A camera angle in which the camera is intentionally tilted to one side, creating a sense of disorientation or unease.

NOTE:

I tried several ways to achieve a conclusive result for a "dutch angle," but I didn't succeed (I tried the three different terms, placed them in different section of the prompt, etc.).

🎥Overhead: A camera angle that looks directly down on the subject from above, providing a unique perspective and context. The camera is usually positioned at a relatively close distance to the subject, providing a clear view of the action or objects below.

🎥Bird's-eye view: This term generally implies a higher vantage point than an overhead shot, as if the viewer were looking down from the sky or a very high altitude. It provides a wider perspective and can capture an entire scene or landscape, offering a sense of scale and context.

NOTE:

While Overhead and Bird's-eye view are often used interchangeably, the main difference lies in the height or distance from which the shot is taken, with a bird's-eye view typically being higher or more distant than an overhead shot.

🎥Drone view: A drone view shot is an aerial camera angle using a drone.

NOTE:

In several of my results, the drone view gives higher perspectives than traditional bird's-eye views and overhead views.

🎥Worm's-eye view: A camera angle that looks up at the subject from ground level, creating a dramatic and unusual perspective.

NOTE:

I tried several ways to obtain a worm's-eye view, but without success. If you have already achieved it consistently in your results, you can share it with us.

🎥Ground-level view: In a ground-level view, the camera is also placed at or near the ground, but the lens is typically pointed straight ahead or parallel to the ground, capturing the subject from a more neutral perspective.

NOTE:

The ground-level view is not consistent and often produces slightly odd results, such as people half-buried in the ground or unusual body positions! 

The best way to use it, according to my experiments, is to place the term in the best possible context, such as:

Ground-level view of a woman lying down on the floor

But, it still often gives incorrect results.

🎥Side view: Side-view typically involves capturing a subject from the side, which can be achieved by using various camera angles like eye-level, low-angle, or high-angle shots.

🎥Off-center view: Off-center refers to a framing technique where the subject is not positioned in the center of the frame, creating a more dynamic and visually interesting composition. 

NOTE: 

While side-view and off-center may not be specifically categorized as camera angles in cinema, they do refer to certain camera positioning techniques.

Both terms can be used in the same way as angles and shot types, with very good results.

Now let's look at the Shot types.

→Shot Types 🎥

🎥Close-up (closeup): A shot that focuses on a subject's face or a specific detail, emphasizing emotion or importance.

NOTE:

Each shot type has its abbreviation, like CU for Closeup. Putting the abbreviation instead of the name didn't really work.

🎥Extreme close-up: A shot that tightly frames a small detail or feature, such as an eye or a piece of jewelry, highlighting its significance.

🎥Wide shot: A shot that shows the entire subject within its environment, providing context and a sense of scale.

🎥Extreme wide shot: A shot that captures a large area, often used to establish a location or set the scene.

NOTE:

For the wide shot and extreme wide shot, the effect is amplified if you use a larger image format, like 16:9, for example.

If you want a different image format, use the --ar followed by the desired image format at the end of your prompt, as in the following example:

A woman standing in front of her house --ar 16:9

🎥Medium shot: A shot that captures the subject from the waist up, often used for dialogue scenes or to convey emotion.

🎥Medium-full shot (American shot): A medium full shot frames the subject from approximately the knees or mid-thighs up. 

NOTE:

Medium-full shot and medium shot don't always give consistent results. Sometimes the medium-full shot looks more like a medium shot and vice versa.

🎥Over-the-shoulder shot: A shot that looks over the shoulder of one subject towards another, commonly used in dialogue scenes to create a sense of depth and connection.

NOTE:

The Over-the-shoulder shot works great if placed in the right context. Otherwise, the results will be very inconclusive.

Here is a good example you can test with a simple prompt:

Over-the-shoulder shot of a woman speaking with her friend

That concludes this brief overview of the most commonly used camera angles and shot types in cinema and photography.

# Midjourney: Quick Tip

If you want to influence how varied the initial 4 images you generate in a grid, use the Chaos parameter at the end of your prompt.

The Chaos parameter can vary from 0 to 100 and the default setting in Midjourney is 0.


https://twitter.com/TheMouseCrypto/status/1647716995008192518
---

Let's see how the chaos parameter affects 4 images in the same grid by using a simple prompt:

A woman looking at the camera

Since the default chaos parameter is already set to 0, we should expect 4 similar images. Indeed, that's the case.

https://twitter.com/TheMouseCrypto/status/1647716996337872897
---
Now let's test a high chaos value (50). To change this variable, add --c 50 at the end of your prompt: 

A woman looking at the camera --c 50

What's interesting in this case is that within the same grid, we get different camera angles, different faces, and even an older woman.

https://twitter.com/TheMouseCrypto/status/1647716997554110467
---
Finally, let's test a very high chaos value (100). Replace the --c 50 with --c100 instead.

A woman looking at the camera --c 100

As you can see, with a very high chaos, the results are even more varied (different camera angles, different poses, more diverse faces, etc.).

https://twitter.com/TheMouseCrypto/status/1647716998867025922
---

Personally, I find this basic parameter useful when I want to get inspired by various initial images before building a more complex scene.

# Midjourney: Quick Tips

- If you want to create amazing manga/anime style images, use the niji parameter at the end of your prompt.

- With a simple step, it is also possible to achieve even more impressive results.


https://twitter.com/TheMouseCrypto/status/1648375906728128512
---
- Using version 5 of Midjourney, let's start with a simple prompt:

- A sad ghost --niji 5

- It really looks like images straight out of a manga, especially the second one!

- But personally, I think the images are quite conventional, without too much details.

https://twitter.com/TheMouseCrypto/status/1648375908405854220
---
- If you want to achieve more advanced artistic results, use one of your images and add the manga style to it using the niji parameters.

- Here's the prompt used to create the image for this little test:

- Closeup of a sad ghost, hyper realistic, hyper detailed photography

https://twitter.com/TheMouseCrypto/status/1648375911589216256
---
- Now let's see what happens when we combine this image with the niji parameter.

- First, click on the image you've already generated with Midjourney, then click on Open in browser and copy the URL of your image that starts with something like this:

https://twitter.com/TheMouseCrypto/status/1648375913078300673
---
- Now click on /imagine and paste the URL of your image at the beginning of your prompt.

- Since we can't use --niji 5 with only a single image prompt, you'll need to write something else in the prompt and add a space right after the pasted link of your photo.

https://twitter.com/TheMouseCrypto/status/1648375914445651979
---
- Here's what your prompt might look like:

https//cdn.discordapp.com/attachments4161555b4.png Sad ghost --niji 5

In my opinion, the results are way much more impressive!

https://twitter.com/TheMouseCrypto/status/1648375915699732480
---
- I experimented with my own Pixar-style character images and here are some results.

Try it with your own images, you'll find in your results some real little gold nuggets!

# Filmmakers 🎬- Midjourney

If you are looking to add some style and atmosphere to your images, you can add a filmmaker's name to your prompt. 

If you start with a simple prompt like this one : 

"A woman in front of her house in a scene from a movie", 

you will get very varied and random results, without much artistic consistency. 

On the other hand, if you want to add, for example, the name of Peter Jackson to the same prompt: 

"A woman in front of her house in a scene from a movie directed by Peter Jackson", 

the results will be completely different and your images will be tinged with the style of this filmmaker, through more coarse elements such as the scenery, the architecture, the clothes worn or sometimes more subtle ones such as the camera shots, the lighting, the colors and the general atmosphere. 

You can be even more precise and add the title of one of the director's movies. In this example it could be "The Lord of the Rings". 

I did some tests and I noticed that adding the name of the movie alone seems to give less refined results than adding the name of the director alone, which seems to give something more coherent and harmonious. 

I invite you to test this and share your results to see if you notice the same or something different.

Finally, and this is even more subtle, but it seems that adding both the name of the director and the name of one of his movies in the same prompt adds a little more to the results. 

You can take it a step further by adding the genre of the movie (for example Science Fiction), the date the movie was released and even the camera and lens used for a particular scene you want to reproduce.

That said, adding a filmmaker's name to your prompt won't magically transform your images into an amazing scene but it will definitely add a special touch to them and it's really fun to try. 

I have compiled a list of some of the greatest filmmakers, sorted by film genre. This list is obviously not complete, but it is a good starting point!
