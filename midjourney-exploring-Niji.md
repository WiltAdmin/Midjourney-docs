# Nijijourney v5 Tips + Resources

In Japanese, [niji] or [にじ] can mean either “rainbow” or “2D.”

The new niji model is tuned with a fine eye to produce anime and illustrative styles with vastly more knowledge of the anime universe.

It's excellent at generating dynamic action shots and character-focused compositions in general.

→ How To Use Niji

Add the following parameters to the end of your prompt [or change them in your /settings] to switch models:

--niji
The version 4 Midjourney model trained on an anime/manga data set that gives a signature style to its outputs.

--niji 5
The latest version 5 model.

→ Anime/Manga
Niji may interpret English words [tokens] in different ways.

It also understands some Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and other Asian languages via behind-the-scenes Google Translate.

Because of its data set, it may play differently with familiar style-words, and will also know a different set of media references and artists [see Useful Resources].

If you want to see anime/manga results, be sure to include style words that invoke anime/manga.

Otherwise, you can use --niji for any style you like, just like any other version.

* Naruto Uzumaki, protagonist of the anime Naruto, portrayed in a dynamic action pose, surrounded by swirling chakra energy in light red and turquoise hues. The artwork is designed in a chromepunk style, with metallic and futuristic elements integrated into Naruto's attire and surrounding environment. The image is inspired by the aesthetics of Ferrania P30 film, resulting in a high-contrast monochromatic look with bold shadows and highlights. The composition follows the approach of social media portraiture, with a focus on Naruto's facial expression and emotion. The background features a vibrant red hue, creating a striking contrast against the character. The art is influenced by the whimsical and fantastical style of Victor Nizovtsev, adding an extra layer of magic and enchantment to the scene. --ar 3:2 --niji 5
